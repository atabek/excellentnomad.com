Hello everybody out there! This will be the [post #1](/hello-world) on my personal blog.
I'll try to update it with useful info. I just want to briefly explain
what was this blog made out of: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs).

My development environment consists of the following:
[Fedora 21] (https://getfedora.org/),
[Atom.io](https://atom.io/).

And also, it required  little bit of [hard work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bF4Dw_CNTys).
